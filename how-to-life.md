4，Transfer from EOS Main Chain

EOS Main Chain User can transfer life by:

a, Send EVD to eoslinker111 , with memo: #HASH#+{AccountName in this world}. Example: Want to send guestabcdefg with 10 EVD , memo should be: #HASH#guestabcdefg

Transfer fee is 0.01 EVD.

b, If do not have EVD (eoslocktoken) , and have EVR (eosvrtokenss). Can transfer EVR to evrexchanges in EOS main chain, will send back same number of EVD. 

Also, send EVD to evrexchanges and send back same EVR. No fee.


c, It do not have EVD or EVR, can transfer to eosvrmarkets with EOS , and it will send back certain EVD, it use Bancor algorithm.

Note: They are all in testing, and send too much will fail. (It is better to send EOS less than 50 , and send EVD less than 50K).
